# Paddy disease classification
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for the automatic classification of diseases in paddy plants using computer vision techniques. Leveraging transfer learning with the DenseNet121 architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, the model is trained to accurately identify various disease categories affecting paddy crops. By automating disease detection, this project seeks to empower farmers with timely insights to mitigate crop losses and ensure food security. Key aspects of the project include data preprocessing, model training with techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting, and visualization of model predictions for improved interpretability.
